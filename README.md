Inspiration: I was inspired to create this project when a relative of mine struggled to find which facilities provided which types of COVID-19 testing. Since almost none of the centers provide this information online, my relative was forced to contact each and every facility to check if they provided a specific type of test. With my program, users will be able to efficiently decide which facilities to go to depending on their specific needs.

What it does: Simply provide your zip code, and the COVID-19 Testing Location Finder will provide a list of centers where you can take a COVID-19 test, and whether each center provides Antigen or PCR Testing.

How I built it: I used the Eclipse IDE and MySQL database.

Challenges I ran into: My initial plan was to create a Java Server Page, but unfortunately ran out of time to efficiently create the web page. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of: While creating this project, I learned how to create a database with MySQL and connect it to my Java code. I also further enhanced my knowledge of Java.

What I learned: I learned that anything is possible if you have a positive mindset, and strive to complete what you started.

What's next for COVID-19 Testing Location Finder: I hope to create the Java Server Page, and add more data so my program can be used in many communities.
